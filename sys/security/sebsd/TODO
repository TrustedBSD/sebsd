* Fix mount point labels - for non-root filesystems, the mount labels
  would like to have a persistent label, but none is provided.  Instead,
  we could use the persistent label stored in the vnode corresponding to
  the root directory within the context of the mountpoint.  However, I
  don't believe you can call VFS_ROOT() within xxx_create_mount to
  retrieve the vnode since the filesystem isn't completely mounted yet (I
  think this is the case at least).

* Implement check_vnode_revoke and check_cred_visible - There are no
  corresponding SELinux checks for these, so we just need to decide what
  the right thing to do is and enforce it.

* Fix locking in sebsd/avc/avc.h - Much of the avc locking code is still
  commented out, this is bad for SMP.  The Linux
  spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_irqrestore calls need to be converted to
  some FreeBSD equivalent.

* Re-sync AVC and SS - avc_has_perm_ref_audit has also diverged from
  SELinux and should be resync'd, probably along with the rest of the AVC
  and Security Server.

* Provide user-space tools for load_policy, enforcing, etc.

* Port/write newrole application

* Port/write run_init application

* Generate a table comparing SELinux and TrustedBSD hooks and coverage

* Fix policy
  - Fix existing policy
  - Remove unused domains and policy components
  - newsyslog is busted
  - cron has issues
