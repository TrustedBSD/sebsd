SEBSD is a on-going port of the SELinux FLASK and Type Enforcement
implementations to run on top of the TrustedBSD MAC framework.  This
work is occurring as part of an extension to the DARPA CBOSS contract
at NAI Labs, and will provide access to NSA FLASK and the Type
Enforcement implementations as pluggable modules on FreeBSD 5.0.

The Flask operating system security architecture provides flexible
support for a wide range of access control policies by cleanly
separating the policy enforcement mechanisms from the policy
decision-making logic.  The Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) project
has implemented this architecture and an example security server that
supports Role-Based Access Controls and Type Enforcement in the Linux
kernel.  SELinux was implemented originally as its own custom kernel
patch and was subsequently adapted as a loadable kernel module that
uses the general security hooks provided by the Linux Security Modules
(LSM) kernel patch.
