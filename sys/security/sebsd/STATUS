This version of SEBSD consists of little more than an initial port of
the SELinux access vector cache (AVC) and security server (SS).
Adding the "SEBSD" option to kernel build will result in a kernel that
attempts to initialize the SS upon boot.  The initialization procedure
requires a compiled (binary format) policy file to be present on the
boot partition, called 'ss_policy'.  If this file is not present, the
kernel will panic upon boot.

The tools to generate and compile the policy have not been ported to
FreeBSD yet, so the policy must be generated on an SELinux machine and
copied over.  Even so, it is more of an experiment, as the policy will
likely have no bearing on the FreeBSD system and nothing is currently
enforced by the SEBSD module.  Upon initializing, a message similar to
the following will be displayed at boot time:

security:  starting up (compiled Mar 26 2002)
security:  loading policy configuration from /ss_policy
security:  15 users, 5 roles, 476 types
security:  29 classes, 54963 rules

This is just a first step in the development of the SEBSD module.  We
are currently working on providing user-space policy tools as well
implementing basic process and file labeling.
