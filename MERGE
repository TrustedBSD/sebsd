Merging TODO:

	devfs changes to pass complete paths of objects into MAC Framework
	for label initialization.

	System V IPC, POSIX Semaphore ABI changes to avoid sharing user
	  and kernel structures.  Probably need to remove module unload
	  changes for now.

	System V IPC, POSIX Sempahore MAC changes to permit labeling
	  and access control by MAC policies.

	ipcs(1) label support.

	Removal of redundant suser check in kern_xxx.c

	NFS client credential fixes.

Consider to merge TODO:

	p_canwait().

	pseudofs uses MNT_MULTILABEL always.

	mac_update_mbuf_from_cipso()

	sppp MAC support

	ppp MAC support

	Biba/MLS sequential compartment set support.

	FFS resilience improvements for EA support

	setfsmac in /sbin

	fsck_ffs ea support

	acl.9 expansions

	ls(1) labels without long form

	mac_support.4 man page showing what is (and isn't) supported
	  with MAC.

	sysinstall(8) support for multi-label file systems.

Probably not to merge, at least not in current form:

	security as a directory in /etc (note: mergemaster handles this
	  poorly).

	Use multilabel md file systems in the diskless environment.

	rc executable so that there's the possibility of a domain
	  transition from init.

	tty labeling in login(1)/login.conf(5), init(8).

	Build a MAC kernel by default, include in installs/releases.

	SAVESTART flag in kern_exec.c -- is this needed?

	missingops?

	truss(1) hexdump support?

	inetd(8) resource limits and labels improvements.
