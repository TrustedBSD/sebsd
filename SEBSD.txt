SEBSD - Security-Enhanced BSD
SPARTA, Inc.

SEBSD is an experimental implementation of NSA's FLASK and Type Enforcement
technologies, ported from SELinux using the TrustedBSD MAC Framework.  SEBSD
consists of the following components:

- FreeBSD 7.x source tree.

- SEBSD policy module (src/sys/security/sebsd/)
	- NSA's FLASK security architecture, including Access Vector Cache
	  (AVC).
	- SEBSD wrapper, to sit between the MAC Framework and FLASK
	- NSA's Type Enforcement policy "security server"

- Modified SELinux sample policy, capable of running (with some limitations)
  on SEBSD.  (src/contrib/sebsd/policy/)

- Modifications to the FreeBSD 7.x kernel to extend the MAC Framework to
  support additional labeling and enforcement points required by SEBSD.
  (src/sys)

- Modifications to the FreeBSD 7.x user space to support transition-based
  labeling changes as part of user credential events.  (src/)

- SELinux userland components, including libsepol, libselinux, libsemanage,
  and policy tools.  (src/contrib/sebsd/{checkpolicy,libselinux,libsepol,
  libsemanage,policycoreutils}/)
