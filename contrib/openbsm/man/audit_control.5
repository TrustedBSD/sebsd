Each line of this file is of the form:
.Pp
.Dl parameter:value
.Pp
The parameters are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa dir
The directory where audit log files are stored.
There may be more than one of these entries.
Changes to this entry can only be enacted by restarting the
audit system.
See
.Xr audit 1
for a description of how to restart the audit system.
.It Va flags
Specifies which audit event classes are audited for all users.  
.Xr audit_user 5
describes how to audit events for individual users.
See the information below for the format of the audit flags.
.It Va naflags
Contains the audit flags that define what classes of events are audited when
an action cannot be attributed to a specific user.
.It Va minfree
The minimum free space required on the file system audit logs are being written to.
When the free space falls below this limit a warning will be issued.
Not currently used as the value of 20 percent is chosen by the kernel.
.El
.Sh AUDIT FLAGS
Audit flags are a comma-delimited list of audit classes as defined in the
.Pa audit_class
file.
See
.Xr audit_class 5
for details.
Event classes may be preceded by a prefix which changes their interpretation.
The following prefixes may be used for each class:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It +
