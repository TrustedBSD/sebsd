Upgrade Instructions for OpenBSM
--------------------------------

OpenBSM integrates into the FreeBSD source tree in several places:

src/contrib/openbsm        The OpenBSM distribution itself
src/sys/bsm                Modified versions of some bsm/ include files
src/sys/security/audit     Kernel audit framework, some OpenBSM-based files
src/usr.sbin/*audit*       Makefiles for various OpenBSM tools
src/etc/Makefile           Installation of /etc OpenBSM files
src/lib/libbsm/*           Build for OpenBSM library

OpenBSM is normally built using an integrated autoconf/automake build
system.  For the purposes of tight integration with FreeBSD, we use an
adapted BSD make (bmake) build system loosely based on the automake
setup.  We also rely on a static config.h generated when OpenBSM is
imported, rather than re-configuring every build.  This leads to a
more reproduceable build environment, and avoids dependence on things
not in the base tree (i.e., autoconf, automake, GNU make, etc).  An
upgrade of OpenBSM generally involves the following steps:

- Vendor import of OpenBSM into src/contrib.
- Run configure, commit src/contrib/openbsm/config/config.h.
- Replication of src/contrib/openbsm/bsm changes into src/sys/bsm.
- Possible updates to src/sys/security/audit, especially relating to
  bsm_token.c.
- Update any library, tool, or etc BSD Makefiles to add new files,
  defines, or other generally useful or necessary things.

Normally, the CVS vendor import goes along the following lines:

  cd ~/p4/projects/trustedbsd/openbsm
  cvs -d rwatson@repoman.FreeBSD.org:/home/ncvs -q import src/contrib/openbsm \
        TrustedBSD OPENBSM_1_0_ALPHA_1

Replacing the version string as required.  Use the "-n" argument to CVS to
do a test run.

Propagation of changes to src/sys/{bsm,security/audit} is something that
requires careful coordination and attention to detail.  These files are
not on CVS vendor branches, but do have the same local vs. vendor merge
issues.
