.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
.Xr audit_event 5
database, which describes audit events.
Entries in the database are described by
.Vt struct au_event_ent
entries, which are returned by calls to
.Fn getauevent ,
.Fn getauevnam ,
or
.Fn getauevnum .
It is also possible look up an event number via a call to
.Nm getauevnonam .
.Pp
.Fn setauevent
resets the database access session for
.Xr audit_event 5 ,
so that the next call to
.Fn getauevent
will start with the first entry in the database.
.Pp
.Fn endauevent
closes the
.Xr audit_event 5
database session.
.Pp
.Fn getauevent
returns a reference to the next entry in the
.Xr audit_event 5
database.
.Pp
.Fn getauevnam
returns a reference to the entry in the
.Xr audit_event 5
database with a name of
.Va name .
.Pp
.Fn getauevnum
returns a reference to the entry in the
.Xr audit_event 5
database with an event number of
.Va event_number .
.Pp
.Fn getauevnonam
returns a reference to an audit event number using the
.Xr audit_event 5
database.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions
.Fn getauevent ,
.Fn getauevent_r ,
.Fn getauevnam ,
.Fn getauevnam_r ,
.Fn getauevnum ,
.Fn getauevnum_r ,
and
.Fn getauevnuam
will return a reference to a
.Ft struct au_event_ent
or
.Ft au_event_t
on success, or
.Dv NULL on failure, with
.Va errno
set to provide further error information.

.Sh AUTHORS
This software was created by Robert Watson, Wayne Salamon, and Suresh
Krishnaswamy for McAfee Research, the security research division of McAfee,
Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
.Sh BUGS
.Va errno
is not always properly set following a failure.
.Pp
These routines are thread-safe, but not re-entrant, so simultaneous or
interleaved use of these functions will affect the iterator.
