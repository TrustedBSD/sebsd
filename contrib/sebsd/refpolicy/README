1) Reference Policy make targets:

General Make targets:

install-src		Install the policy sources into
			/etc/selinux/NAME/src/policy, where NAME is defined in
			the Makefile.  If not defined, the TYPE, as defined in
			the Makefile, is used.  The default NAME is refpolicy.
			A pre-existing source policy will be moved to
			/etc/selinux/NAME/src/policy.bak.

conf			Regenerate policy.xml, and update/create modules.conf
			and booleans.conf.  This should be done after adding
			or removing modules, or after running the bare target.
			If the configuration files exist, their settings will
			be preserved.  This must be ran on policy sources that
			are checked out from the CVS repository before they can
			be used.

clean			Delete all temporary files, compiled policies,
			and file_contexts.  Configuration files are left intact.

bare			Do the clean make target and also delete configuration
			files, web page documentation, and policy.xml.

html			Regenerate policy.xml and create web page documentation
			in the doc/html directory.

Make targets specific to modular (loadable modules) policies:

base			Compile and package the base module.  This is the
			default target for modular policies.

modules			Compile and package all Reference Policy modules
			configured to be built as loadable modules.

MODULENAME.pp		Compile and package the MODULENAME Reference Policy
			module.

all			Compile and package the base module and all Reference
			Policy modules configured to be built as loadable
			modules.

install			Compile, package, and install the base module and
			Reference Policy modules configured to be built as
			loadable modules.

load			Compile, package, and install the base module and
			Reference Policy modules configured to be built as
			loadable modules, then insert them into the module
			store.

Make targets specific to monolithic policies:

policy			Compile a policy locally for development and testing.
			This is the default target for monolithic policies.

install			Compile and install the policy and file contexts.

load			Compile and install the policy and file contexts, then
			load the policy.

enableaudit		Remove all dontaudit rules from policy.conf.

relabel			Relabel the filesystem.

checklabels		Check the labels on the filesystem, and report when
			a file would be relabeled, but do not change its label.

restorelabels		Relabel the filesystem and report each file that is
			relabeled.

2) Reference Policy Files and Directories
All directories relative to the root of the Reference Policy sources directory.

Makefile		General rules for building the policy.

Rules.modular		Makefile rules specific to building loadable module
			policies.

Rules.monolithic	Makefile rules specific to building monolithic policies.

build.conf		Options which influence the building of the policy,
			such as the policy type (strict, targeted, etc.)
			and distribution.

config/appconfig-*	Application configuration files for all configurations
			of the Reference Policy (targeted/strict with or without
			MLS or MCS).  These are used by SELinux-aware programs.

config/local.users	The file read by load policy for adding SELinux users
			to the policy on the fly.

doc/html/*		This contains the contents of the in-policy XML
			documentation, presented in web page form.

doc/policy.dtd		The doc/policy.xml file is validated against this DTD.

doc/policy.xml		This file is generated/updated by the conf and html make
			targets.  It contains the complete XML documentation
			included in the policy.

doc/templates/*		Templates used for documentation web pages.

policy/booleans.conf	This file is generated/updated by the conf make target.
			It contains the booleans in the policy, and their
			default values.  If tunables are implemented as
			booleans, tunables will also be included.  This file
			will be installed as the /etc/selinux/NAME/booleans
			file.

policy/constraints	This file defines additional constraints on permissions
			in the form of boolean expressions that must be
			satisfied in order for specified permissions to be
			granted.  These constraints are used to further refine
			the type enforcement rules and the role allow rules.
			Typically, these constraints are used to restrict
			changes in user identity or role to certain domains.

policy/global_booleans	This file defines all booleans that have a global scope,
			their default value, and documentation.

policy/global_tunables	This file defines all tunables that have a global scope,
			their default value, and documentation.

policy/flask/initial_sids  This file has declarations for each initial SID.

policy/flask/security_classes  This file has declarations for each security class.

policy/flask/access_vectors  This file defines the access vectors.  Common
			prefixes for access vectors may be defined at the
			beginning of the file.  After the common prefixes are
			defined, an access vector may be defined for each
			security class.

policy/mcs		The multi-category security (MCS) configuration.

policy/mls		The multi-level security (MLS) configuration.

policy/modules/*	Each directory represents a layer in Reference Policy
			all of the modules are contained in one of these layers.

policy/modules.conf	This file contains a listing of available modules, and
			how they will be used when building Reference Policy. To
			prevent a module from  being used, set the module to
			"off".  For monolithic policies, modules set to "base"
			and "module" will be included in the policy.  For
			modular policies, modules set to "base"	will be included
			in the base module; those set to "module" will be
			compiled as individual loadable	modules.

policy/rolemap		This file contains prefix and user domain type that
			corresponds to each user role.  The contents of this
			file will be used to expand the per-user domain
			templates for each module.

policy/support/*	Support macros.

policy/users		This file defines the users included in the policy.

support/*		Scripts and other tools used to help build the policy.
