nfs_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for NFS
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the nfs server via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  So by 
default SElinux policy does not allow nfs to share files.  If you want to 
setup this machine to share nfs partitions read only, you must set the boolean nfs_export_all_ro boolean.

.TP
setsebool -P nfs_export_all_ro 1
.TP
If you want to share files read/write you must set the nfs_export_all_rw boolean.
.TP
setsebool -P nfs_export_all_rw 1

.TP
If you want to use a remote NFS server for the home directories on this machine, you must set the use_nfs_home_dir boolean.
.TP
setsebool -P use_nfs_home_dirs 1
.TP
system-config-securitylevel is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
