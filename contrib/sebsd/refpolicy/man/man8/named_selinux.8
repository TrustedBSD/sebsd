.SH "NAME"
named_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the Internet Name server (named) daemon
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the named server via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  So by 
default SElinux policy does not allow named to write master zone files.  If you want to have named update the master zone files you need to set the named_write_master_zones boolean.
.TP
.br
setsebool -P named_write_master_zones 1

.TP
You can disable SELinux protection for the named daemon by executing:
.TP
setsebool -P named_disable_trans 1
.br
service named restart
.TP
system-config-securitylevel is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
