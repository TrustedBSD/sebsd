# Role-based access control (RBAC) configuration.

dnl This file formerly contained a set of centralized role declarations.
dnl These role declarations have been partitioned up among the various
dnl .te files.

dnl Role transition rules are deprecated.  Role transitions should be
dnl explicit, e.g. via login and newrole.  Use domain transitions within a 
dnl role for automatic changes of permissions upon program execution.

dnl This file is now merely for role allow rules, as described below.

# Role allow rules.
#
# A role allow rule specifies the allowable
# transitions between roles on an execve.
# If no rule is specified, then the change in
# roles will not be permitted.  Additional
# controls over role transitions based on the
# type of the process may be specified through
# the constraints file.
#
# The syntax of a role allow rule is:
# 	allow current_role new_role ;
# 
# Allow the admin role to transition to the system
# role for run_init.
#
allow sysadm_r system_r;
